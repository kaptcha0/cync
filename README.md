# Notion Calendar Sync
A simple WIP that syncs iCal files pulled from the internet to a Notion database.
A goal will be to add 2-way compatibility, but from the calendar to Notion is OK for now.

## Required Environment Variables
- NOTION_KEY
	- Holds the Notion integration token
- NOTION_DATABASE_ID
	- Holds the ID for the Notion database that will be acting as Notion's calendars

See [the Notion docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started) for help on these variables.
